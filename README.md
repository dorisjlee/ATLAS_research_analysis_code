PyROOT code for analyzing collision data

Some of the code from the particle physics research I did from July 2012 to August 2013 with Professor O'Neil at SFU. The code included here is by no means comprehensive.
Only a few scripts from many were selected to be posted here in order to provide code samples that are representative to the types of analysis I did.
A report of what I learned and did is summarized in the pdf file. The appendix also contain some sample code.
